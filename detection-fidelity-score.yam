## Intended audience

- Detection Engineers
- SecOps Architects
- Privacy Engineers
- Security Platform Teams
- CISOs seeking defensible trade-off decisions

## Philosophy

Privacy is not the opposite of detection.  
It is a **design constraint**.

DFS treats detection as an engineered system operating under real-world limits — and measures how that system behaves.

---

## Status

This repository defines a **benchmark and methodology**, not a finished product.

The pace of implementation follows evidence and demand — not hype.
