DFS Principles
Foundational Principles of Detection Fidelity Score

DFS is built on the premise that automated security decisions must be governed by engineered trust — not implicit confidence.

The following principles define the philosophical and structural foundation of the model.

1. Trust Must Be Engineered

Trust in detection and automation systems cannot be assumed.

It must be:

Explicitly defined

Bounded

Tested

Continuously revalidated

Unengineered trust scales fragility.

2. Degradation Is Inevitable

All detection and automated decision systems degrade.

Degradation occurs through:

Loss (absence of signal)

Distortion (semantic alteration)

Drift (decay of assumptions)

The question is not whether degradation exists —
but whether it is visible and governed.

3. Automation Scales Both Confidence and Error

Automation increases speed and reach.

Without explicit trust boundaries, it also scales:

False positives

False negatives

Operational disruption

Institutional blind spots

Automation is not neutral.
It amplifies the quality of underlying trust.

4. Silence Is Not Evidence

Absence of alerts does not imply absence of risk.

Silence is trustworthy only when:

Telemetry presence is validated

Loss conditions are bounded

Signal integrity is continuously monitored

Unvalidated silence is structural blindness.

5. Trust Boundaries Must Be Explicit

Every automated decision must declare:

What evidence it depends on

What degradation invalidates it

What impact it carries

Who revalidates it

Implicit trust boundaries are unmanaged risk.

6. Drift Is the Default State of Systems

Systems evolve.
Attackers evolve.
Telemetry evolves.
Assumptions decay.

Drift is not an anomaly.
It is the natural state of operational environments.

Trust must be continuously recalibrated.

7. Governance Precedes Scale

Automation should not scale before trust is bounded.

Scale without governance accelerates fragility.

Governance without engineering is theater.

DFS exists to connect both.

Closing Statement

DFS is not a control framework.

It is a discipline for engineering and governing trust in automated decision systems.

Trust must not be assumed.

It must be designed.
