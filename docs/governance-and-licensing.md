DFS Governance & Licensing Philosophy
Intent

Detection Fidelity Score (DFS) is intended to become a shared language for engineering and governing trust in automated security decision systems.

The long-term goal is industry adoption — not exclusivity.

Open Core Philosophy

The conceptual foundations of DFS are open:

Loss, Distortion, Drift

Trust Decision Boundaries

Governance Tiers

Degradation Testing Principles

Core architectural models

These concepts are intended for broad adoption and industry refinement.

DFS core exists to enable:

Shared terminology

Transparent reasoning

Cross-organizational alignment

Academic and industry discussion

Implementation Layer

While the core model is open, structured implementation frameworks may evolve independently.

This may include:

Formal assessment methodologies

Automation readiness evaluations

Trust boundary validation tooling

Drift detection systems

Enterprise governance playbooks

Training and certification programs

The distinction ensures:

Conceptual openness

Professional implementation rigor

Sustainable long-term development

Governance Philosophy

DFS governance emphasizes:

Transparency of trust assumptions

Explicit automation eligibility

Continuous revalidation

Auditability of automated decisions

DFS rejects:

Implicit automation

Unbounded AI autonomy

Trust based solely on historical confidence

Governance as superficial documentation

Attribution & Integrity

DFS was originally formulated by Gustavo [Your Name].

The integrity of its conceptual foundations must be preserved to prevent dilution or misrepresentation.

Constructive critique and evolution are encouraged.

Conceptual distortion for marketing simplification is discouraged.

Long-Term Vision

DFS aims to:

Improve the cognitive maturity of security professionals

Provide defensible automation governance

Enable responsible AI-assisted decision systems

Reduce systemic risk introduced by unbounded automation

DFS is designed for durability, not trend cycles.
