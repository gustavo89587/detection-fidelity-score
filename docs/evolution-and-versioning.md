DFS Evolution & Versioning Policy
Purpose

DFS is designed as a durable engineering model.

To preserve conceptual clarity while enabling growth, its evolution must be intentional, documented, and governed.

This document defines how DFS evolves over time.

Versioning Model

DFS follows a structured versioning approach:

MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION

Example:

v1.0.0

v1.2.0

v2.0.0

MAJOR Version

A MAJOR version increment indicates:

Structural change to core domains (Loss, Distortion, Drift)

Modification of Trust Decision Boundary model

Redefinition of Governance Tiers

Changes that alter foundational principles

Major versions are rare and deliberate.

They require:

Public explanation

Rationale documentation

Migration guidance

MINOR Version

A MINOR version increment indicates:

Extension of governance model

New domain testing methods

Additional application examples

Clarifications that expand scope without redefining structure

Minor updates refine and strengthen the model.

REVISION (Patch)

A REVISION increment indicates:

Clarifications

Wording improvements

Non-structural refinements

Example corrections

Revisions do not change conceptual meaning.

Conceptual Stability Commitment

The DFS core domains:

Loss

Distortion

Drift

Trust Decision Boundary

are considered foundational.

Changes to these domains require MAJOR version increments and explicit justification.

Conceptual stability is prioritized over rapid expansion.

Governance of Changes

All structural changes must include:

Clear problem statement

Justification

Explanation of impact

Migration guidance (if applicable)

DFS evolution must remain transparent and reasoned.

Backward Compatibility Philosophy

When possible:

Extensions should preserve previous interpretations

Governance tiers should remain comparable

Terminology consistency must be maintained

If incompatibility is necessary, it must be explicit.

Community Input

Constructive critique is encouraged.

However:

Changes must preserve structural integrity

Marketing-driven simplification is not a valid evolution driver

Conceptual dilution is rejected

DFS evolves through rigor, not popularity.

Long-Term Vision

DFS is designed to mature over years, not trend cycles.

Its evolution will prioritize:

Conceptual clarity

Operational applicability

Governance robustness

Cross-domain adaptability

Stability builds trust.

Trust builds adoption.

Adoption builds durability.

Closing Statement

DFS will evolve.

But it will evolve deliberately.

Trust in automated systems depends on the stability of the models that govern them.

DFS must model the same discipline it demands.
