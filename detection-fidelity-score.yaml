Intended Audience

DFS is designed for professionals responsible for the integrity of detection systems:

Detection Engineers

SecOps Architects

Security Platform Teams

Privacy Engineers balancing signal and data minimization

CISOs and security leaders seeking defensible trade-off decisions

DFS is most useful where detection decisions carry operational, reputational, or regulatory weight.

Philosophy

Detection and privacy are not opposing forces.
Privacy is a design constraint, not a barrier.

DFS assumes detection systems operate under real-world constraints:

Partial telemetry

Schema evolution

Performance limits

Legal and privacy boundaries

The question is not whether degradation exists —
but whether it is understood, measured, and made explicit.

DFS treats detection as an engineered trust system.
And engineered systems must define how they fail.

Status

DFS currently defines a methodology and benchmark model, not a finished implementation.

Its evolution prioritizes:

Conceptual rigor

Operational applicability

Evidence-driven iteration

Development follows signal and real-world validation — not hype cycles.
